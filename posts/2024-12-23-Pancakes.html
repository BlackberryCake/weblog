<h1>Pancakes</h1>
<h4>23 December 2024</h4>
<p>It’s cold, so I’ve been busting out the pancakes, the English crepe-y kind. A little lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon, in whatever combo/quantity is getting me through these chilly mornings!</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 Eggs</li>
<li>120g Flour</li>
<li>120ml Milk</li>
<li>120ml Water</li>
<li>Butter</li>
</ul>
<p>Super easy to remember, with easily replaceable ingredients. I use soy milk and margarine, and if I’ve got no eggs on hand just skip them entirely, or try replacing with a dash of oil. Nothing can stand between you and your goal of making a bready disc. 😁</p>
<p>In my frying pan, I get five to six pancakes, and thanks to the easily divisible numbers you can scale it up or down depending on what you’ve got or how hungry you are!</p>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<br><small>Mix Eggs and Flour First</small></center>
<center><img style="max-width: 720px; " src="../images/PCake02.webp" alt="Milk and Water added, mixed until smooth.">
<br><small>Add Milk and Water, mix out as many lumps as you can!</small></center>
<p>Heat up butter in a frying pan. I don’t know how hot it has to be, I mean, I do know but only for my stove, you’ll have to experiment on your end. That’s part of the fun, don’t worry about singeing a few pancakes!</p>
<p>Add enough batter to thinly cover the base of the pan, flip once you see it mostly solid on the top side.</p>

<br><small>Flip as many times as you want</small></center>
<p>Top with whatever you want, or eat as they are. I personally think pancakes are best enjoyed the instant they’re done, so once I plate it up, I’m digging in while making the next one.</p>

<br><small>Enjoy!</small></center>
