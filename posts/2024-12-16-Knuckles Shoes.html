<br><small>Knuckle's Shoes!</small></center>
<p>This post is dedicated to the Sonic x Reebok shoes I got for my birthday. These are the Knuckles edition shoes and dang, they look so good! I've never put on a pair of shoes and thought &quot;Damn, these are cool&quot;, but I'm a changed man now. Please enjoy these small photos.</p>

<br><small>The tongue, which I definitely knew without looking it up</small></center>
<p>You can barely see it here, but the inside is has the classic checkerboard pattern too. Very nice.</p>

<br><small>A bonus life</small></center>
<p>In the official images the suede, I assume it's suede anyway, looked way to fuzzy, but in person it's great.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 512px; max-height: 512px;" src="../images/KShoes04.webp" alt="A close up of the back of shoe, showing off two small spikes, reminiscent of Knuckles Gloves.">
<br><small>Two small surprisingly hard and sharp spikes</small></center>
<p>If it wasn't for these small spikes, you couldn't tell there was anything Knuckles about these shoes.</p>

<br><small>Weirdly low resolution box art</small></center>
<p>One odd detail was the knockoff looking box, what's with the extremely low resolution art? Not the greatest first impression.</p>
