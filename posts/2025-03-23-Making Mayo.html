<h1>Making Mayo</h1>
<h4>23 March 2025</h4>
<p>I’ve read enough isekai manga to know that being able to introduce mayonnaise to whatever generic fantasy world you’ve been thrown into is not only a crucial skill, it’s essentially a cheat code to easy living. If you don’t know why, don’t worry. Point is, I wanted to make Mayo.</p>
<p>A couple of YouTube videos later and I feel appropriately educated to give it a go. At its core, it really is just mixing oil and eggs. Most videos recommend adding mustard, for flavour and as an additional emulsifier, as well as lemon juice. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m7Q6VxDYP8" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPlYSxiBUFQ" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/yFDeiAyNau0" target="_blank">many</a> videos that cover the exact same method of adding eggs, oil, mustard, salt and lemon juice to a jar, and blending them using an immersion blender. I settled on the following amounts.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two Eggs</li>
<li>1.5 Cups of Oil</li>
<li>1 tbsp of Lemon Juice</li>
<li>1 tsp of Mustard</li>
<li>1 tsp of salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Thirty seconds of blending later and yeah, it’s mayonnaise. What surprised me was how fast it came together, a couple of seconds and it went from a liquid to that thicker mayo’y consistency. I feel like I shouldn’t be so surprised, but what can I say, it really was like a magic trick. Food is cool!</p>

<p>I’m no food photographer, so you might think it looks gross, but in person it really does look like a store bought mayo, and is pretty dang good in a sandwich!
Is it as good as a jar of Hellmann’s? No. I’ll give it a couple more goes though, I can imagine it being nicer with a bit more mustard and lemon juice, or maybe even nicer quality oil. I went with sunflower oil, but picking one with a more distinctive flavour must dramatically affect the end result.</p>
<p>I would like to try making it without an immersion blender, but I haven’t replaced my whisk since it broke in a particularly thick cake batter. Apparently the only real difference is that the oil seasoning can’t be part of the original mixture and must instead be mixed together slowly to ensure the mayo doesn’t split. Which would leave you with a rather gross separated mayo… I think. I guess I’ll find out when I give that one a go in the future.</p>
<p>So, there we have it. Dump me in a fantasy world, with easy access to those ingredients and an immersion blender and I’m good to go.</p>
