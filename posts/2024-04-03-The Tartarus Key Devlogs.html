<p>Hi there, Tartarus Key fans - Leo and Kevin here, and happy holidays! Vertical Reach has been hard at work on the game, so we wanted to give you a closer look at our progress throughout development, starting with the decisions and considerations that went into the game’s iconic visual style, which adds so much to the haunting vibes of the game.</p>
<p>The Tartarus Key uses a retro aesthetic strongly influenced by PS1 classics, like the iconic Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Multiple horror series got their start on the system; as a result, many people find the look and genre impossible to separate. There’s something truly fascinating, off-putting, eerie - any uneasy or spooky adjective would work here - about the look of PS1 games. Growing up, even a game like Spyro could suddenly look at a lot more menacing after dark.</p>

<p>We’ve enjoyed trying to imbue The Tartarus Key with that same energy. Paintings with textures just low-resolution and wobbly enough that appear to have their eyes follow you around the room. NPC's that, even though they're simply staring in your direction, suddenly take on a frightening quality - incapable of blinking, their faces wobbling unendingly in time to their idle animations. We had playtesters ask why we had the detective character occasionally wink at them, and with a small chuckle, I got to respond with a deliciously scary, &quot;We didn't.” I think there's a lot to be said about retro 3D artsyles. Like with Spyro after dark, sometimes the spookiest parts of our game are the ones you imagine.</p>
<p>But what about the parts we made? When it comes to the art of The Tartarus Key, we're aiming to feel authentic instead of being authentic. Being authentic would require setting hard rules, and while making a game within those limitations would be an exciting challenge, it isn't what we set out to do. At its core, The Tartarus Key uses many of the PS1's iconic visual 'quirks', we've got: texture perspective warping, vertex wobbling, low-resolution textures, low poly models, limited colour depth, heavy fog and tragically short draw distance all rendered at a beautifully tiny 360p.</p>

</center>
<p>These alone give the game a distinctive look, but as we're not working with actual PS1 hardware we're aiming to modernize some of the rougher edges. Borrowing from the power of future technology we break the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Widescreen</strong> - 4:3 resolution is great, and our game fully supports it, but we've put a lot of work into how this game looks, so we wanted to give it the love it deserves in full 16:9!</li>
<li><strong>Shadows</strong> - The majority of PS1 games used vertex lighting which was only as accurate as your number of vertices... so usually not very. Considering a lot of The Tartarus Key is spent exploring dark rooms with a flashlight, we opted to go with more modern shadows.</li>
<li><strong>Number of on-screen objects</strong> - Modern low-poly art expectations have moved on from what hardware was genuinely capable of at the time. Your PC can render a heck of a lot more than the PS1 could, so we're putting its power to work. Instead of rendering a single cube with a bookshelf texture, The Tartarus Key renders each book individually. It's not the most authentic artistic choice, but it's more important to us that it looks and feels appropriately low-poly.</li>
<li><strong>Modern post-processing effects</strong> - We use post-process vignettes, colour grading, ambient occlusion, and other tricks that were simply impossible on the PS1’s hardware but add to the game’s overall atmosphere.</li>
<li>Also, <strong>The Tartarus Key is a first-person game</strong>, and those were relatively uncommon back in the PS1 era.</li>
</ul>

</center>
<p>This led to adapting the art direction in interesting ways. Using Resident Evil as an example, let's take a closer look. Resident Evil has fixed cameras, sometimes encompassing a fairly large area. Characters had to remain recognizable at low resolutions and great distances. Capcom did this by making character models realistic but chunky, ensuring they'd be visible at a distance. As is common with early PS1 games, each character was made up of discrete, separate models - for example, thighs were separate from calves. This was easier to animate in lieu of joint-based systems, which were new at the time. The lower rendering resolutions of consoles at the time gave characters a distinct capsule look while making it easier to hide the disjointed body parts that made up each model. Texture-wise, all objects are meant to be realistic to visually match the prerendered backgrounds.</p>

</center>
<p>However, we took a more stylized approach with The Tartarus Key. Our character models are sleeker, as we expect the player to see them up close and personal. This meant we could worry less about how characters look from a distance. We opted to have characters be made up of one mesh; our models are slightly higher poly than the average Resident Evil character, so we felt a joint-based animation solution would look nicer. Our textures are also more stylized and painterly, which was a purposeful decision so that characters will more closely match their in-game dialogue portraits.</p>
<p>That’s it from us for now. Thanks for reading! Now, why not kick back, relax, and forget about the fact you’re trapped in a big, spooky mansion with this relaxing Tartarus Key holiday yule log?</p>

<h2 id="devlog-02">Dev Log #02: People Then vs Now</h2>
<p>Hey everyone! Dora here, your friendly neighborhood producer. While the team is hard at work polishing puzzles and blasting bugs, I thought I'd step in to share an update.</p>
<p>The Tartarus Key has been in development with us for over a year, and in that time I've seen the game change in some pretty big ways. Some of these come down to scrapping puzzle designs and rebuilding them from the ground up, or reworking the mansion's layout. But one of the more interesting examples I can give is how the cast has changed their style.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 320px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog02-01.webp" alt="Alex's in-game portrait."></center>
<p>Our intrepid reluctant protagonist, Alex Young, is an easy example. This is Alex as you'll meet her in the game. An average young woman stuck in an unlikely scenario. But in the beginning, the team experimented with her personal style in a way that made her look a little less average, and a little more cool and capable. Someone who looked a little tougher in a way that says, &quot;Hey you, freaky mansion! I'm not scared of you!&quot;</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog02-02.webp" alt="Various Alex Concepts."></center>
<p>Ultimately, however, we liked the idea of a protagonist who didn't look quite so capable. We're hardly the first game to go this route - Harry Mason of original Silent Hill fame is another example of an ordinary person in an extraordinary scenario. But we felt it might make Alex easier to connect to and root for.</p>
<p>Once we had her basic look down, we wanted to refine her dialogue portrait. Because the game is in a first person perspective, you don't really get to see Alex the way you do other characters, so having somewhere she could be seen and be expressive was really important. As you can see from these sketches, the final design changed a little from concept to conclusion, but not drastically.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog02-03.webp" alt="The initial Alex portraits."></center>
<p>And this is the end result! Say hi, Alex!... wow, she looks mad.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>Beyond Alex, of course, every other character you'll meet has a portrait for dialogue, and a range of expressions to boot. Take Charles, for instance; he's one of the characters you'll meet in the game. He's a well-meaning but scatterbrained academic type, so we wanted his design to reflect a person who was intelligent, but probably also a little easily distracted and nervous.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog02-05.webp" alt="Charles' in-game portrait."></center>
<p>Fun fact; while all of these characters are drawn and animated by hand thanks to our artist Leo Parra, there was a time when we considered going a different route with AI generated and animated portraits. In theory, this might have saved us some time, and anyone who has had anything to do with video game development knows time is one of the most valuable resources you have to keep track of. You can see an early experiment of that below.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 320px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog02-06.webp" alt="AI Charles."></center>
<p>While it's not bad, we wound up deciding against it for a few reasons. One of the biggest is that it simply didn't fit the look and feel of the game, which as you likely can already tell was heavily influenced by what are now considered &quot;retro&quot; low-poly titles from the PSOne era. We felt this might be a little more modern than we were shooting for.</p>
<p>There was also a lack of control, since while you could set some parameters, ultimately you got what the computer gave you. We could have painted over the results to make them truly look like what we were shooting for, but at the end they likely would have needed such extensive work that we would have negated any time we would have saved. And that would have made our producer very sad.</p>
<p>(Me. It's me. I'm the producer. I would have been sad.)</p>
<p>Anyway, that's it for this month! We're hard at work putting together a lot of finishing touches for the game, but that doesn't mean we're done. We're looking forward to being able to share more news with you soon! Thank you for reading, and for all your support!</p>

<h2 id="devlog-03">Dev Log #03: Atmosphere vs Jumpscare</h2>
<p>Hey everyone! We thought this was a great opportunity for us to talk a bit about how we approached some of the scarier elements of The Tartarus Key, and why we often went with creepy vs cacophonous when it comes to our scares.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog03-01.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>When we first started developing the game, we wanted it to be entirely devoid of jumpscares. While a lot of people really love them, we know for some people they can make a game challenging or unpleasant to play, so we were determined to avoid them completely. And we did, for much of development! Atmosphere is about building tension and fear overtime, through the visuals and sound. This is harder to pull off and involves making something that appears scary in the mind of the player. The same kind of fear that people feel looking into a dark room, it's more about what could be there, regardless of if it's rational or not.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we found this really limiting. Most people take &quot;jumpscare&quot; to mean &quot;something unexpected pops up in your face and screams really loudly&quot; or the equivalent. But more subtle sudden movements, loud noises, even when used in moderation, are jumpscares too. Used carefully, a jumpscare is just another tool to enhance the players' experience. We do believe that players are more apprehensive about jumpscares now due to the rise in horror games that use them. After all, they lose their effectiveness with repetition. If every candle in the game blew out as you approached it then by the third <em>POP</em> you would probably start to be more annoyed than surprised. Remember this classic?</p>
<center>
<video width="488" autoplay="" muted="" loop="">
  <source src="../images/ttkdevlog03-02.webm" type="video/webm">

</center>
<p>It's a sliding scale. Not all jumpscares are equal in that not all of them are intended to accomplish the game thing. There are no screaming ghost faces in TTK, but you might find doors that slam shut as you approach them, candles that go out, and books that fall. These are jumpscares, largely involving motion or sound that you weren't expecting, but we soften the blow by making sure that the player was already looking in the direction and aware of what was happening. We try to avoid having things surprise from offscreen.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog03-03.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>Atmosphere is hard, and sometimes ineffective, because you can't predict how people will respond to it. An example we had early in our playtesting is the very first hallway you can enter near the beginning of the game. One of our testers opened the door and simply refused to step into the hallway, to paraphrase &quot;No, I can't. Something's going to get me.&quot; It took a lot of reassuring and promises to get them to move on. Darkb bloody hallways have a way of scaring people - can't imagine why. Another didn't give it a second thought, threw the door open and ran straight to the next room; hadn't even considered it scary.</p>
<p>The end result is that a lot of time has gone into trying to strike that balance between &quot;this is creeping me out&quot; and &quot;this is way too much&quot;. Some of the scares we have are blink-and-you'll-miss-them subtle, while others are more in-your-face. However, we've tried to make sure The Tartarus Key is unsettling more often than it purely makes you jump, and we hope when you finally play it, you'll agree... and appreciate those few jumps all the more.</p>

<h2 id="devlog-04">Dev Log #04: Mirrors!</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of our game, The Tartarus Key, is the implementation of reflective mirrors. While most modern games rely on screen space reflections or render targets to achieve realistic mirror effects, we decided to take a different approach and draw inspiration from classic games like Mario 64.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog04-01.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>For some of the mirrors in the game—take the bathroom mirror, for example—we duplicated the entire room and cut a hole in the wall for the player to look through. This process is lengthy, but it allows us to achieve a realistic mirror effect, while also remaining authentic to the era of games that inspired us, without using any camera trickery. The end result was worth the effort, as the mirrors look great, function how we hoped, and during playtesting were a feature that stood out to players. A surprising number of players would comment on the mirrors, and other devs would theorise about the method we used to create them. We never realised people liked mirrors so much!</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog04-02.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>However, due to the time-consuming process of creating reflective mirrors in this way, we opted for different solutions for the majority of the other mirrors in the game. For example, we intentionally made some mirrors &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;dirty&quot; to work around the limitations of our aesthetic and development time!</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog04-03.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>During the implementation process, we also encountered an issue where the player character, Alex, would poke through the mirror if she got too close to the wall. To address this, we simply detect the player's proximity to the wall and shrink Mirror Alex to a teeny tiny size whenever necessary. Some solutions are more entertaining than others!</p>

<p>Our decision to use a unique method to create mirrors in The Tartarus Key provided a distinct visual style for the game. While it was a lengthy process, we believe that it was worth it for the special mirrors that are featured in the game. We’re excited to see how players react to these mirrors during key moments, and how they impact the overall experience of playing The Tartarus Key!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="devlog-05">Dev Log #05: Sigil Symbology</h2>
<p>We are thrilled to reveal further details on The Tartarus Key, and delve into the mysterious and enigmatic world of Sigil design in the game.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog05-01.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>The Tartarus Key is infused with Symbols, Sigils, Magical Circles, and other esoteric drawings. Our designs are rooted in real historical alchemy, chemistry, and demonology from the Ancient and Middle Ages.
Referencing historic Grimoires on demonology such as the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;, as well as real medieval alchemy and transmutation concepts, we've researched the intricate nature of these designs, ensuring that they are both authentic and compelling.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog05-02.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>Our research ensured that each design was not only unique but also aligned with the historical and medieval alchemical concepts that served as the foundation of our work.
All while adding our own mysterious twists to enhance their mystique, as well as more modern aesthetics.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog05-03.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>Sigils play a crucial, but hidden role in the game's story and gameplay. Players will find themselves immersed in a world of mystery, uncovering the hidden meanings of each Sigil as they journey through the game.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog05-04.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>We hope that our attention to detail in the Sigil design will provide players with an immersive and captivating gaming experience.
The world of The Tartarus Key shrouded in mystery and intrigue, and we can't wait for players to uncover the secrets hidden behind each Sigil.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, and we'll see you in The Tartarus Key!</p>

<h2 id="devlog-06">Dev Log #06: Text Accessibility</h2>
<p>In The Tartarus Key, we place a lot of emphasis on story and narrative, which means that players will be reading a lot of text throughout the game. As a result, we wanted to make the reading experience as comfortable and accessible as possible for as many players as we could.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we implemented several accessibility features that players can toggle in the options menu. Today, we’d like to walk you through some of them!</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog06-01.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>Our first example is text backgrounds. If players ever have trouble reading the text on screen, they can choose to add a solid black background to all dialogue and narration, which makes the text easier to read due to the high contrast.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog06-02.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>We also added the option to change the colour of the text itself from the default yellow and red to standard black and white. This can be particularly helpful for players who may have trouble distinguishing between certain colours, or for those who simply prefer a more monochromatic aesthetic!</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog06-03.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>In addition to these colour options, we also included the ability to choose a sans serif font, which some players may find easier to read. We understand that readability can be affected by a variety of factors, and by providing these options, we hope to accommodate as many players as possible and make the game more comfortable for everyone.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog06-04.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>Along with our text options, we also provide other optional features for players to utilize, such as disabling camera shake, toggling sprint instead of holding and more. Still, our work didn’t end there—we also took care to ensure all of our puzzles are colourblind-friendly and will never place players under time constraints.</p>
<p>We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy our game. By providing a range of accessibility options, we hope to create a more inclusive gaming community and make The Tartarus Key a welcoming experience for all players!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="devlog-07">Dev Log #07: Paintings Puzzle</h2>
<p>Today, we'd like to take a moment to share some insights into the puzzle development of The Tartarus Key. During the early stages of the game's creation, we experimented with many different ideas of varying complexity and depth. One of these concepts was a puzzle that involved swapping paintings of horrifying creatures to unlock certain areas of the game.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the process of designing these creatures was both fascinating and challenging. Basing the designs on historical demonic beings, we aimed to create a sense of dread and unease in the players as they uncovered and examined these terrifying demons. We painted each creature with the goal of eliciting a unique emotional response, ranging anywhere from disgust to outright terror.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog07-01.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>Unfortunately, during playtesting, we discovered that the puzzle was too confusing and detracted from the overall experience. As a result, we made the tough decision to scrap the entire puzzle, including most of the artwork we had created for it; though a keen-eyed player might notice a couple of the paintings do make an appearance.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog07-02.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>While we were disappointed to lose the puzzle, we took solace in the fact that we had the opportunity to design some truly grotesque creatures. Even though they didn't all make it into the final version of the game, we are proud of the work we did and are excited to share it with you.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog07-03.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>We want to assure you that we are committed to creating the best possible experience for our players, and we’re not afraid to experiment with new ideas, even if they don't always pan out. We hope you enjoy exploring the twisted world of The Tartarus Key as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, and we'll see you in the game!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="devlog-08">Dev Log #08: Puzzle Progression and Mansion Gating</h2>
<p>We put a lot of thought into the design aspect of gating access to the mansion and opening it up, as well as puzzle difficulty, to create the best possible player experience. Initially, the player is only allowed in a small set of rooms, which unlock one after the other. We consider this the introductory tutorial area of the game, where players can get a feel for the mechanics and story without feeling overwhelmed or lost.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog08-01.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>After meeting Torres, the game opens up massively, allowing players to wander the halls of the mansion as they see fit. While many doors are locked at first, players can get a greater sense of scale and begin to understand the layout of the mansion. Our intention was to have two tracks of puzzles available to the player after the tutorials, so that if they got stuck, they could go off and try another room. The map comes in handy here, as it highlights rooms of interest!</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog08-02.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>As players progress through the game, they'll find that puzzles slowly increase in difficulty, building up their skills and knowledge in the process. Players will eventually have to complete both tracks to finish the game, with each containing their own unique characters and unlocking different areas of the mansion. Depending on how they choose to play, their experience can vary quite dramatically from another player's!</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog08-03.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>As players approach the end of the game, the two puzzle tracks merge back into one, with rooms naturally leading from one to another. This allowed us to control the pacing of the ending and account for the multiple endings in a way that made sense to us.</p>
<p>We've conducted play tests and have received positive feedback thus far, and we hope players will enjoy exploring the mansion, tackling its puzzles, and experiencing the game's multiple endings!</p>

<h2 id="devlog-09">Dev Log #09: Music</h2>
<p>Music is a vital element in setting the tone and atmosphere of any game, and developing the soundtrack for The Tartarus Key was one of the pivotal processes in bringing our vision to life. Working alongside the incredibly talented composer, <a href="https://www.josiebrechner.com/">Josie Brechner</a>, was a true privilege, and her outstanding work spoke for itself. One of the many highlights of collaborating with her was witnessing how she interpreted our minimal direction and somehow managed to create precisely what we envisioned.</p>
<p>At the outset of the game's development, we had the initial areas mapped out and planned, but a significant portion of the game was still in the “grey box” phase. We provided Josie with detailed story information for each character and area, as well as video walkthroughs to illustrate where the puzzles would go. Additionally, we gave her a &quot;colour&quot; to represent each character's personality traits - for example, William was associated with the colour purple, as we believed it conveyed a sense of luxury and extravagance.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 640px;" src="../images/ttkdevlog09-01.webp" alt="Replace Alt."></center>
<p>Despite providing only what we considered to be minimal details, Josie consistently responded with enthusiasm, saying &quot;Perfect, that's great!&quot; She would then proceed to send us a perfectly crafted track within the week, capturing the essence we desired for each character.</p>
<p>Each track was produced on a per-character basis, with three tracks per character, each increasing in intensity. This approach allowed us to blend between tracks seamlessly as the puzzle difficulty increased or as tension built within the story. The music that players hear at the beginning of the game is vastly different from what they hear at the end, highlighting the versatility and range of Josie's compositions.</p>
<p>We hope that players will appreciate and enjoy the music that Josie created as much as we do. Her extraordinary talent and contributions have undoubtedly elevated the game to new heights, and we are incredibly grateful to have worked with her.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="devlog-10">Dev Log #10: Maps</h2>
<p>In The Tartarus Key, we take great care to ensure that every aspect of our game is designed with the player experience in mind. One detail that we're particularly proud of is the map system, which we've designed to be both functional and immersive.</p>
<p>Early in the game, Alex is given a map by Torres to help navigate the mansion. However, we didn't want to create a standard, boring map that simply showed players where to go. Instead, we wanted to create a map that felt like a real object in the game world, with its own personality and quirks that shift and change as the game progresses.</p>

<p>That's where Alex comes in. As players explore new areas, Alex will add them to the map in real time, creating a sense of immersion and exploration that really brings the game world to life. As you discover rooms, solve puzzles, or experience certain events, she'll leave little notes commenting on what she's seen or how she feels. Our hope is that players find her notes useful, entertaining, and at times, even relatable.</p>

<p>Despite our efforts to make the map an integral part of the player experience, we noticed during playtesting that some players were not engaging with it as much as we had hoped. Essentially, they were forgetting that it existed.</p>
<p>In response, we added a visual prompt paired with a sound effect that reminds players to use the map when they enter a new room for the first time. We believe that this small addition will make a big difference in how players engage with the game world, and ensure that they have the smoothest possible experience playing The Tartarus Key.</p>

<h2 id="devlog-11">Dev Log #11: Texture Trickery</h2>
<p>We wanted to take a moment to talk further about some of the design choices we made in The Tartarus Key that we think adds to the game's charm and appeal, such as the deliberately low resolution of the game's graphics and textures.</p>
<p>We made a conscious decision to embrace an aesthetic inspired by PlayStation 1 visuals for the game, both allowing us to more quickly and effectively create assets as a small team, as well as create a unique and memorable atmosphere. On top of that, we love the gritty, low-fi look that this style provides!</p>

<p>One of the unexpected benefits of working with low-resolution textures is the artistic freedom it gives us. Because players would be unable to read small text on assets, we've had a lot of fun filling the game world with silly and absurd labels and designs. For example, you might find food cans with labels like &quot;Brand - It's food probably, wow!&quot; and &quot;Sardines - Food Food Food&quot;.</p>
<p>While we typically take our game design very seriously, we also believe that a little bit of humour can go a long way in making a game more enjoyable. We hope that these little touches add to the overall experience of The Tartarus Key and bring a smile to your face.</p>

<p>We want to thank all of our fans for their support as we continue to refine and improve the game. We're excited to see what you think of the low-res aesthetic and the quirky humour it allows us to incorporate into the game world.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, and we'll see you in the game!</p>
