<h1>Clicking Watch</h1>
<h4>9 March 2025</h4>
<p>Here’s a small thing I made all the way back in November, 2022. It's sat privately on my itch page this entire time. Today's the day I finally unleash the <a href="https://kmaki.itch.io/clickingwatch" target="_blank">Clicking Watch</a>!</p>
<center><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed-upload/6880993?color=F2CC0F" allowfullscreen="" width="640" height="380"><a href="https://kmaki.itch.io/clickingwatch">Play Clicking Watch on itch.io</a></iframe></center>
<p>The Clicking Watch is an homage to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hudson-shooting-watch" target="_blank">Hudson Shooting Watch</a>. A toy from the 80’s where the goal was to see how many times you could push a button in ten seconds. Any description of it is closely associated with the fact that Toshiyuki Takahashi - &quot;Takahashi Meijin&quot;, a Hudson Soft Employee, could famously press a button <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_Meijin#16_shot_per_second" target="_blank">sixteen times per second</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen any mention of the toy being made specifically because of his incredible button pushing skills, but he was a popular personality running a yearly <a href="https://retroxp.substack.com/p/remembering-hudson-soft-a-history" target="_blank">Caravan Festival</a> at the time. Combined with Hudson’s library of SHMUPs it must have been an easy reason to make a button pressing machine.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Takahashi and his time with Hudson, there's <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-master-speaks-hudson-s-takahashi-meijin-goes-retro" target="_blank">this neat interview</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the Clicking Watch itself, there's not a lot to it. I quite like how I decided to handle the timer aspect, with the beat appearing along the bar letting you know how long you had left.</p>
<p>Anyway, try to beat my ninety-nine! ⏱️</p>
