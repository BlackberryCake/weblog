<br><small>Shoes, Knuckles edition</small></center>
<p>This post is dedicated to the Sonic x Reebok shoes I recieved for my birthday. They're the Knuckles edition shoes and dang, they look so good! I've never put on a pair of shoes and thought &quot;Damn, these are cool&quot;, but I'm a changed man now.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 720px; max-height: 720px;" src="../images/KShoes02.webp" alt="A close up of the tongue.">
<br><small>The tongue, which I definitely knew the name of without looking up</small></center>
<p>You can barely see it here, but the insole also has the classic checkerboard pattern too. Very nice.</p>

<br><small>A bonus life</small></center>
<p>In the <a href="../images/KShoes05.webp" target="_blank">official images</a> the suede, I assume it's suede anyway, looked way to fuzzy, but in person it's great. Much less prominent.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 720px; max-height: 720px;" src="../images/KShoes04.webp" alt="A close up of the back of shoe, showing off two small spikes, reminiscent of Knuckles Gloves.">
<br><small>Two small surprisingly hard and sharp spikes</small></center>
<p>If it wasn't for these small spikes, you couldn't tell there was anything Knuckles about these shoes.</p>
<center><img style="max-width: 720px; max-height: 720px;" src="../images/KShoes06.webp" alt="A close up of the box, showing off the weirdly low resolution art. Feels very knockoff.">
<br><small>Weirdly low resolution box art</small></center>
<p>One odd detail was the knockoff looking box, what's with the extremely low resolution art? Not the greatest first impression.</p>
<p>Okay, that's it. I love the shoes. Thank you, goodbye.</p>
