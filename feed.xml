		<title>Pixelgraph</title>
		<description>One of the reasons I wanted to start this blog was to have a place I felt comfortable sharing the various smaller projects I like to bash out over a weekend or two.  So, it feels only fitting that the first post I make should be about one of those projects!</description>

		<title>Sonic X Reebok</title>
		<description>This post is dedicated to the Sonic x Reebok shoes I recieved for my birthday. They're the Knuckles edition shoes and dang, they look so good! I've never put on a pair of shoes and thought &quot;Damn, these are cool&quot;, but I'm a changed man now.</description>

		<title>Pancakes</title>
		<description>It’s cold, so I’ve been busting out the pancakes, the English crepe-y kind. A little lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon, in whatever combo/quantity is getting me through these chilly mornings!</description>

		<title>Fatal Fury's Unapproachable Beta</title>
		<description>If you keep up with fighting games at all, you probably knew about the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves beta that finished up last weekend. I’ve been excited for this one, having only ever dabbled with King of Fighters, Garou: Mark of the Wolves is easily my favourite of SNK’s fighters. A full-on sequel twenty-six years later is pretty wild.</description>

		<title>Clicking Watch</title>
		<description>Here’s a small thing I made all the way back in November, 2022. It's sat privately on my itch page this entire time. Today's the day I finally unleash the Clicking Watch!</description>

		<title>Breezy Game Recommendations</title>
		<description>A couple of weeks ago I responded to a Resetera thread where the OP was asking for breezy one to four hours game recommendations. I love these kinds of threads, as they’re always great for finding games I didn’t know about, but also for sharing games that maybe others haven’t yet tried themselves!</description>

		<title>Making Mayo</title>
		<description>I’ve read enough isekai manga to know that being able to introduce mayonnaise to whatever generic fantasy world you’ve been thrown into is not only a crucial skill, it’s essentially a cheat code to easy living. If you don’t know why, don’t worry. Point is, I wanted to make Mayo.</description>

		<title>The Zelda Depths Are Cooler Than I Thought!</title>
		<description>Recently I’ve been watching Leo slowly one hundred percent Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and it’s been an enjoyable time. Every time I walk by I see something new that I either didn’t know existed, or had more depth, heh, than I originally thought it had.</description>

		<title>A Bad Week For Fighting Games</title>
		<description>I hadn’t really seen myself writing this sort of reactive news based post, but the last week or two in fighting games have been pretty interesting. I wanted to get some of it written down, plus my own reactions, as a time capsule of sorts. At some point in the future I’ll get to look back and say, “Remember when Trump was second by second dismantling human rights and destroying the economy? Oh, and Tekken was kind of bad too.”</description>
