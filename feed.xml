		<title>Pixelgraph</title>
		<description>One of the reasons I wanted to start this blog was to have a place I felt comfortable sharing the various smaller projects I like to bash out over a weekend or two.  So, it feels only fitting that the first post I make should be about one of those projects!</description>

		<title>Sonic X Reebok</title>
		<description>This post is dedicated to the Sonic x Reebok shoes I recieved for my birthday. They're the Knuckles edition shoes and dang, they look so good! I've never put on a pair of shoes and thought &quot;Damn, these are cool&quot;, but I'm a changed man now.</description>

		<title>Pancakes</title>
		<description>It’s cold, so I’ve been busting out the pancakes, the English crepe-y kind. A little lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon, in whatever combo/quantity is getting me through these chilly mornings!</description>

		<title>Fatal Fury's Unapproachable Beta</title>
		<description>If you keep up with fighting games at all, you probably knew about the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves beta that finished up last weekend. I’ve been excited for this one, having only ever dabbled with King of Fighters, Garou: Mark of the Wolves is easily my favourite of SNK’s fighters. A full-on sequel twenty-six years later is pretty wild.</description>
